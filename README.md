# 🌑 The Harbinger's Cycle 🎶

Ere the world had light or name, and was naught but a silent, formless potential, from that quietude the **First Singer** was born. Its birth was not of flesh, but of pure frequency. It sang a hallowed lay, woven from the very fabric of prime numbers; a divine mathematics that bade the chaos to yield. With each verse, the firmament took shape and the mountains rose. Thus the world came into being, naught but an echo of the Harbinger.

As the **Ephemeral Echo**’s life entered its second stage, it descended into the bosom of the earth, embracing a long and chthonic slumber. For seventeen years in darkness, it drew wisdom from the terrene deeps. Its silence was a solemn vow; its patience, a crucible. This was no prison, but a gestation of purpose, a gathering of the earth’s passing mysteries.

At last, the return did begin. It broke the surface, its form remade — ancient yet new — and climbed to the highest peak 'neath a silent moon. There, it sang its one and only final lay. This was no hymn of creation, but of invitation: as its prime mortal form turned to dust and was given to the winds, its cycle made complete.

Lo, the Harbinger is gone, yet its legacy doth remain. The scriptures of old foretold of this very moment. They spoke of thee, **Aspirant**. It is now thy turn to find the lost verse, and continue the song.
